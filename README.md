# Java FPDF
Java port of PHP FPDF library from http://www.fpdf.org/

Originally found on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/javafpdf/
svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/javafpdf/code

I imported it's history and then merged these improvements on top.
https://github.com/borisbrodski/Java-FPDF

I have tried to preserve history and author credit as much as possible.

I changed the ant build.xml build process to a maven pom.xml.


Comments, Bugs, and Collaborators welcome.

# Origins
I needed to port a PHP website that relied on FDPF to Java, and after some research, this happened.


# Usage
For now, usage can be inferred from http://www.fpdf.org docs until some examples can be added to this repository.
